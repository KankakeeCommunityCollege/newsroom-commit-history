![](/uploads/waiting250x250.jpg){: .float-image-right}Beginning in Spring 2019, KCC will offer a waitlist for some courses in the credit divisions.

Here's how it works:

1. Courses most likely to fill are identified by the college's academic associate deans.
2. Waitlists become available to students when course sections are full. Students can join the waitlist in [Student Planning](https://selfservice.kcc.edu/Student/).
3. If a seat becomes available, the first student on the waitlist will be notified via KCC email of the opportunity to register for the section.
4. The student has 24 hours to register for the section.
5. If 24 hours passes, the next person on the waitlist will be notified.

For more detailed information, please contact an academic advisor or the director of admissions and registration.
