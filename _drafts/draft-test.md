Kankakee Community College has been named the top junior college in Illinois for helping students land a job after graduation according to Zippia, a career advice website dedicated to helping recent college graduates with their career choices.

Zippia identified the best colleges for employment in each state using the Department of Education's College Scorecard data for the number of people who were employed 10 years after graduation.

“Finding a job in today’s economy is becoming less and less of a certainty, even for those with a college degree, an issue that can be exacerbated when you’re looking at colleges that offer 2-year rather than 4-year degrees,” the Zippia site says. “Those looking at 2-year degrees are hoping to jump into the work force as soon as possible, and so a college’s reputation for placing its students can have a huge influence on their choice of school.

Zippia looked at the employment levels for all college graduates a decade after students had earned their degrees and identified the school in each state with the highest placement rate. KCC’s placement rate is 87.10 percent.

“KCC continues to provide great value and job preparation for our community,” said the college’s president, Dr. John Avendano. “The college is dedicated to preparing a strong workforce and supporting our area in growth and the success of students.

“The commitment of our students, faculty and staff to success is apparent in this data, and Zippia’s recognition is a nice acknowledgement.”

KCC operates the Charlton Family Foundation Career Services Center to offer students and graduates support at every stage of the job search.

KCC is an accredited two-year college which awards associate degrees and certificates of completion. KCC prepares students both to transfer to four-year colleges and to enter the workforce.

The college also offers job fairs, continuing education courses, certification training, literacy programs, English as a Second Language and high school equivalency preparation.
