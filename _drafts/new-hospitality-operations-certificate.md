A new Hospitality Operations certificate will be an option for KCC students beginning Fall 2019.<br>The 18-credit hour certificate packages two existing KCC courses along with four newly developed courses. It prepares students to enter the hospitality profession in hotels, restaurants, banquet and entertainment venues or meeting, convention and event planning settings. Employment opportunities are in restaurants, chambers of commerce, tourism destinations, recreation businesses and hotels.<br>“Entrepreneurship is the first class in the series because we see this program attracting entrepreneurs who are looking for the knowledge, skills and connections they need to develop an idea into a reality,” said Boyd. “We want this program to attract dreamers and innovators who have disruptive ideas that can transform the attractions of the area.”<br>Courses will be taught at KCC, with internship experiences at area facilities.<br>“Local businesses are interested in our hospitality students as interns and future employees.” said Dr. Michael Boyd, vice president for Instruction and Student Success. “We held a discussion with industry leaders in collaboration with Kankakee County Convention and Visitors Bureau and we had an overwhelming response.”<br>“We are proud to be a voice representing the tourism and hospitality industry and grateful that Kankakee Community College recognizes the need for a formal Hospitality Management academic program,” said Staci Wilken, executive director of the Kankakee County Convention and Visitors Bureau. “We hope this program can prepare students to roll out the red carpet for our guests.”<br>Students will be encouraged to earn Illinois Restaurant Association credentials in food handling, sanitation, alcohol and allergens. The hospitality classes also can be taken toward an associate degree, which can transfer to a hospitality program at a four-year college or university in Illinois to earn a bachelor’s degree.
