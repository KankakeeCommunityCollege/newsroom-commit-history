![](/uploads/tropicante1---copy-1.jpg){: .float-image-left}The community is invited to enjoy a performance of Latin Dance Music in celebration of National Hispanic Heritage month on Wednesday, October 17 in the College Center at Kankakee Community College.

The musical performance by Tropicante will begin at noon. Tropicante is a four-person ensemble, which has traveled nation-wide and internationally, bringing smiles to thousands with its contagious, upbeat music.&nbsp;

Hailing from the sultry savannas of Colombia and the warm beaches of Panama, Tropicante's lead singers, Karin Stein and Ed East, will keep you energized with the sound of popular Latin beats. You'll be swinging and clapping to the Colombian "cumbia," the Dominican "merengue," the Venezuelan "tambor," the Brazilian "samba," and more. The ensemble's lively concerts are sprinkled with first-rate musicianship, anecdotes, and humor.&nbsp;

KCCâ€™s student life office and the humanities and social science division are hosting this event. The performance is free and open to the public.

For more information contact Linh Williams, coordinator of student life and development at KCC, at 815-802-8628 or email ltwilliams@kcc.edu.

KCC is located south of downtown Kankakee off River Road, near U.S. 45-52, or take Interstate 57 to Exit 308 and follow the signs.
