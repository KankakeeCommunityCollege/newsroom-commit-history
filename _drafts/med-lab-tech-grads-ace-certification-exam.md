Twelve KCC graduates took the test between May and September. The comprehensive report of test scores was released in early November. While 100 percent of KCC graduates who took the exam passed the test, 81 percent of students nationwide passed.

All the KCC graduates are employed in the field of medical laboratory technology, said Glenda Forneris, director of the program at KCC.
