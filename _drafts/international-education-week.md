Nov. 12-16 is [International Education Week](https://iew.state.gov/)&nbsp;- a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education used to celebrate the benefits of international education and exchange worldwide.

Did you know:

* KCC has international students from Australia, Brazil, Germany, Israel, South Korea, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vietnam.
* KCC has a [Global Awareness Club](http://www.kcc.edu/students/studentlife/clubs/Pages/global-awareness-club.aspx) which strives to educate and raise awareness of international culture to create a student-centered group on diversity issues.

There are several benefits to international education including, but not limited to:

* International students foster a diverse campus environment and enhance learning by offering different cultural perspectives.
* International students can broaden domestic students’ cultural views and perceptions, promoting understanding, inclusiveness and respect. This global view is beneficial in an increasingly connected world.
* The Association of International Educators' (NAFSA)&nbsp;[latest analysis](http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/infographic_econ_value_2017.pdf) finds that the 1,078,822 international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $36.9 billion and supported more than 450,000 jobs to the U.S. economy during the 2016-17 academic year (NAFSA, 2016). NAFSA is the world's largest nonprofit association dedicated to international education and exchange.
* By studying in the U.S., international students broaden their worldview, experience the U.S. student lifestyle, can choose from a broad range of programs, gain experience in their field of study, and make diverse friendships.

How to show support for international students:

* Post an [International Education Week](http://www.kcc.edu/admissions/Documents/International%20Education%20Week%202018/IEW_GeneralPoster_Design%202.pdf) or [You are Welcome Here](http://www.kcc.edu/admissions/Documents/International%20Education%20Week%202018/YouAreWelcomeHere_Poster1.pdf){: target="_blank"} poster. Printed posters are available in KCC’s Welcome Center.
* &nbsp;#YouAreWelcomeHere is a welcome message from U.S. higher education to international students around the world. It is a campaign designed to affirm that our institutions are diverse, friendly, safe and committed to student development. &nbsp;Learn more here.
* Use the hashtag #YouAreWelcomeHere and/or #IEW2018 in your social media posts to demonstrate the way KCC supports and values international students.
