The community is invited to enjoy a free “Halloween Spooktakular” extravaganza, on Wednesday, Oct. 24 at Kankakee Community College.

The event will begin at 5 p.m. with children’s activity stations sponsored by various KCC Clubs & organizations including face painting, glitter tattoos, arts/crafts and much more.

At 7 p.m., Tim Hannig will spread his Pro-Kids- “People Respecting Others” message in a fun filled variety show packed with all kinds of tools to engage the audience as the messages are delivered through magic, music, comedy, audience participation, and even funny puppet sidekicks.

Concessions will be available for purchase.

This event is hosted by KCC’s Student Life office and is free and open to the public.
