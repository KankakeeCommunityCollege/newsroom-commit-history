The certificate program can be completed by taking five eight-week classes over the course of three semesters. Microsoft Word and PowerPoint will be offered during the fall 2018 semester, Access and Excel during the spring 2019 semester, and Office Suite Integration will conclude the certificate during the summer 2019 semester.
