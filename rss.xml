&lt;p&gt;The day will begin with a reception and viewing of artwork from 10-11 a.m. A ceremony honoring veterans will be at 11 a.m. Nov. 8 in the lower-level of the KCC Harold and Jean Miner Memorial Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/ray-olley-wwii-veteran-at-the-podium---2017---copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-image-left&quot; /&gt;The event is free and the public is invited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art exhibit—which will be on display Nov. 7 to Dec. 7—features works of &lt;a href=&quot;http://yvettempino.com/&quot;&gt;Yvette Pino&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran who served in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the recognition ceremony, posting of the colors will be from the Marine Corps League Detachment 1253.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://news.kcc.edu/2018/10/26/15-acre-solar-array-planned.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/solar-array---mid-day-photo-credit-pivot-energy---copy-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-image-left&quot; /&gt;A new energy solution is coming to Kankakee Community College’s Riverfront Campus, with a 15-acre solar array scheduled for completion early in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photovoltaic field will be an educational tool for students in the college’s Electrical Technology program, and also will tie into its electric service to provide significant savings on electricity costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pivotenergy.net/&quot;&gt;Pivot Energy&lt;/a&gt; will provide the equipment, and will be responsible for installation and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Pivot Energy’s project development manager, Liz Reddington, the solar array at the college will produce about 4,000 megawatt hours per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anticipated savings to KCC is more than $40,000 per year for the first 10 years, and more than $140,000 per year for up to two decades after that, said Todd Jenkins, project liaison for KCC. Jenkins said cumulative savings over 25 years are estimated at $3.2 million. This figure represents more than 30 percent of the college’s electric bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This solar project is being donated to the college by Dr. Sarode Pundaleeka,” said Kelly Myers, executive director of the KCC Foundation. “Normally, the power purchase agreement is for a 20 year term or longer, but KCC is using a unique donation model for the project, and system ownership will be turned over to KCC after 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The solar electric system will give students, in the short term, a view on the process of installing a large PV (photovoltaic) array, construction, layout, connections, integration into the college’s electrical system,” said Clay Sterling, a KCC professor who coordinates renewable energy-related programs. “In the long term, the large solar PV array will give students in the Renewable Energy program the opportunity to be involved with semiannual operations and maintenance activities that will be required as a part of validating the operations of the PV system.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/solar-array-with-plantings-2---photo-credit-pivot-energy---copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-image-right&quot; /&gt;Sterling said operations and maintenance, or the validation of operations, is a growing field and one that does not yet offer much training.&lt;br /&gt;“KCC students will now have the classroom as well as the field experience to test the existing system, create reports, analyze data from previous tests, maintain records etc.,” Sterling said. “Students will build upon the work of previous classes on a living system here on campus that will be here for, potentially, the next half century.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/overhead-view--proposed-solar-array-at-kcc---photo-credit-pivot-energy---copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-image-left&quot; /&gt;The installation site is on the south edge of the campus, near River Road and the college’s wind turbine. It will be set back from River Road by at least 250 yards, and surrounded by a 7-foot chain link. Before full operation begins, ComEd will test the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approvals from several government bodies, including the Kankakee City Council, are still needed. If those approvals are granted, it is hoped that land preparation work can begin in winter 2018, with construction and completion of the project in spring 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KCC offers an &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2018-2019/Academic-Catalog/Programs/Occupational-Programs/Technology/Electrical-Technology-Renewable-Energy-Technology-Track-AAS&quot;&gt;Associate in Applied Science in Electrical Technology with a renewable energy track&lt;/a&gt;, as well as certificates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/2018-2019/Academic-Catalog/Programs/Occupational-Programs/Technology/Electrical-Technology-Certificates&quot;&gt;solar-PV technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/2018-2019/Academic-Catalog/Programs/Occupational-Programs/Technology/Electrical-Technology-Certificates&quot;&gt;solar-thermal technology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/2018-2019/Academic-Catalog/Programs/Occupational-Programs/Technology/Electrical-Technology-Certificates&quot;&gt;small wind technology&lt;/a&gt;. Four courses within the programs are accredited by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nabcep.org/&quot;&gt;North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog/Courses/ELTR-Electricity-Electronics/ELTR-1064&quot;&gt;Fundamentals of Electricity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/current/Academic-Catalog/Courses/ELTR-Electricity-Electronics/ELTR-1174&quot;&gt;National Electric Code &amp;amp; Wiring Methods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Academic-Catalog/Courses/ELTR-Electricity-Electronics/ELTR-1503&quot;&gt;Survey of Renewable Energy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Academic-Catalog/Courses/ELTR-Electricity-Electronics/ELTR-2334&quot;&gt;Intro to Solar-Photovoltaic Tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kccs-commitment-to-sustainability&quot;&gt;KCC’s commitment to sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In November 2018, KCC was named No. 2 in North America for sustainability performance among associate degree colleges by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The college was a charter signatory of the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 50kW wind turbine was installed in 2011. It offsets some of the college’s electric expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More than 95% of exterior lighting at the college is LED lighting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11 water fountains at the college have bottle fillers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The college’s North Extension Center in Bradley was Kankakee County’s first LEED Gold building.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new Advanced Technology Education Center (set to open in January) is being built to meet LEED Gold specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;environmental-impact-of-solar-arraysprovided-by-pivot-energy&quot;&gt;Environmental impact of solar arrays&lt;br /&gt;Provided by Pivot Energy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No pollution or emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtually no glare – Reflected light from solar PV modules have less intensity than direct sunlight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimal noise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low-growth, native vegetation plantings will be added. No chemicals or pesticides will be used to maintain the native vegetation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The land under the panels will not be in agricultural use, allowing soil to rebuild. At the end of the system’s life (30-40 years), the college will be able to restore the land to its original condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://news.kcc.edu/2018/10/25/young-adult-job-fair.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/farm--fleet---copy-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-image-left&quot; /&gt;On Monday, Nov. 12, Kankakee Community College will host a Job Fair for young adults between the ages of 16 to 24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Job Fair will be from 3-5 p.m. at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kcc.edu/nec&quot;&gt;KCC North Extension Center&lt;/a&gt;, 450 N. Kinzie Ave. in Bradley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an opportunity for young adults to connect with local employers, and gain job search experience,” said Ken Crite, KCC coordinator of career services. “Employers will share what they are looking for and conduct pre-screening interviews.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job seekers attending the event should dress well, as if they are going to an interview, Crite said. Dressing appropriately is a good way to show employers they are serious about being professional, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 10 businesses will be at the Job Fair. If participants need resumes, they are encouraged to visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kcc.edu/coned/careerservices/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;KCC’s Career Services Center&lt;/a&gt; for assistance before the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Job Fair is sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kcc.edu/future/yaps/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;KCC Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Young Adult Program&lt;/a&gt;, which is funded by the Grundy Livingston Kankakee Workforce Board. For additional information, phone 815-802-8222 or email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kcrite@kcc.edu&quot;&gt;kcrite@kcc.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://news.kcc.edu/2018/10/24/new-waitlist-option.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/waiting250x250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-image-right&quot; /&gt;Beginning in Spring 2019, KCC will offer a waitlist for some courses in the credit division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Courses most likely to fill are identified by the college’s academic associate deans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waitlists become available to students when course sections are full. Students can join the waitlist in &lt;a href=&quot;https://selfservice.kcc.edu/Student/&quot;&gt;Student Planning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a seat becomes available, the first student on the waitlist will be notified via KCC email of the opportunity to register for the section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The student has 24 hours to register for the section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If 24 hours passes, the next person on the waitlist will be notified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more detailed information, please contact an academic advisor or the director of admissions and registration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>10/18/2018</updated>
      <id>https://news.kcc.edu/2018/10/18/alumni-profile---taylor-bradley</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://news.kcc.edu/2018/10/18/alumni-profile-taylor-bradley.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/taylor-bradley-9292.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-image-left&quot; /&gt;Taylor Bradley has always been fascinated with law, politics, and helping others understand their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I dropped out of high school at 15 and got my GED after I found out I was pregnant,” Bradley said. “My son was my motivator for sure. I felt like I couldn’t make him go to school unless I went back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bradley began attending Kankakee Community College in the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program. She received a scholarship from the KCC Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, she cried in her advisor’s office. “I was really bad at the program at first,” Bradley said. “Dr. (Kristine) Condon told me we were going to get through it together. She asked how I learned best. I’m a very visual learner so she adapted her teaching style to accommodate me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bradley’s grades shot up, and she branched out in her studies by taking a paralegal special projects course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“(Judge Michael) Kramer and Dr. Condon knew I was bilingual so they assigned me with two other students to the Democracy Commitment project to create self-represented litigant user guides and instruction videos,” Bradley said. “I used three different translation software (packages), the court house interpretive staff, and my own knowledge to translate the guides into Spanish. I tested them on my Spanish-speaking friends, and they worked.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2018, Bradley and her partners—Marta “Mattie” Gulyash and Sara Cleveland—received a national honor, the Bernie Ronan Award for Student Action. “They court house didn’t have anything like this before our project, so our work is really meeting a need.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating from KCC, Bradley completed a paid internship at the Kankakee County Courthouse, and she now works as a paralegal and office manager at Alan F. Smietanksi Law Firm in Bradley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much more to know,” Bradley said. “I think I’ll go back and continue taking classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s worth the struggle. If I didn’t have my son, if I didn’t have to struggle through classes, I don’t think I’d be where I am today. I’m now very appreciative of everything because I started with nothing. I had to work for it all and the things I learned along the way are priceless.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>
