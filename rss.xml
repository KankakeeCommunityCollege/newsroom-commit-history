&lt;p&gt;“The First Six Session of Therapy” is designed to help practitioners increase first session attendance, engage clients in the first five minutes of contact, and increase attendance in future sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presenter, Mark Sanders, said there is research which shows that clients make the most progress in the first six weeks of counseling, but most are no-shows at the second session. The seminar is designed to help turn around those statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics will include feedback informed counseling, behavioral couples counseling, motivational incentives and stage-based incentives. Sanders also will share information on how to accelerate progress through tasks and overcome resistance within the first three sessions of counseling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanders is an author and speaker on behavioral health issues. His presentations have reached thousands throughout the U.S., Europe, Canada, the Caribbean and British Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar meets Friday, Sept. 14 from 8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. at KCC in the Iroquois Room. Course no. is HLTH 438A.A13. Cost is $79, and includes handouts and 6 contact hours for nurses, nursing home administrators, social workers and counselors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://news.kcc.edu/2018/08/07/news-on-co-curricular-transcripts.html">&lt;p&gt; The co-curricular transcript system is no longer available. The company which provided the co-curricular transcript service has chosen to sunset the project. &lt;br /&gt;KCC’s Office of Student Life is researching new programs to possibly replace the co-curricular transcript system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A co-curricular transcript is a record of your campus and community involvement and leadership experiences. It can be sent to other colleges, universities or employers to highlight your achievements, experiences and skills. &lt;/p&gt;
