      <content:encoded><![CDATA[![](/uploads/DHolstein.jpg){: .float-image-left}Dr. David Holstein. a long-time junior college coach and administrator has written C3: Christ Centered Coaching, Utilizing Faith to Impact Athletes.

A KCC alumnus, Holstein spent three decades coaching basketball at KCC, 17 as an assistant and 13 as head coach. He also was KCC’s athletic director for 15 years. After retiring from KCC in 2008, Holstein served as athletic administrator at Palm Beach State College in Florida for eight years. Holstein-Book-Cover

![Photo of Dr. David Holstein's book C3: Christ Centered Coaching]({{ page.baseurl}}uploads/Holstein-Book-Cover150x150.jpg){: .img-fluid.float-right}

“As it is in the athletic world where our student athletes have been bestowed with physical skills, we as believers have been provided with spiritual skills," Holstein said. "In both worlds I feel we have an obligation to develop those skills because they are gifts from the Lord Jesus Christ. Our journey as coaches of faith and our mandate is to develop our witness with the power of the platform. My prayer is that through the witness of C3, coaches of faith will continue to grow and mature in the knowledge of the Lord and transcend that in whatever way they choose is right for them. In addition, I would hope because of the leadership dialogue in C3 that non-believers picking C3 up will consider a Christian way of life as a good way to enhance their world.”

C3 will be available online at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/C3-Centered-Coaching-Utilizing-Athletes/dp/1632694670){: target="_blank"}, [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/c3-dr-db-holstein/1128310908?){: target="_blank"} and [Deep River Books](http://deepriverbooks.com/books/c3-christ-centered-coaching/){: target="_blank"} beginning June 14.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[![](/uploads/Breitbarth_small.jpg){: .float-image-left}“Everyone is marketing something—whether it’s yourself or your business,” said the presenter, Wayne Breitbarth. “Don’t let another day pass without acquiring the knowledge you need to open doors and get dramatic results.”

The seminar will have two presentations, and participants can attend one or both. Registration is not required.

“LinkedIn: A Student’s Fast Track to Internships and Jobs” will be from 10 a.m. - noon.

“If you’re interested in quickly and easily creating a strong LinkedIn presence and growing a network that will open doors, this class is for you,” Breitbarth said.

Topics relate to using LinkedIn to finding a job, including creating a winning profile, tapping into a database of resources, developing a network, the best keywords, and connecting with school alumni to locate opportunities.

“The Power Formula for LinkedIn Success” will be from 1:30-3:30 p.m.

“This class has something for everyone,” Breitbarth said. “Whether you’re a social media novice or savvy user, you’ll come away with action steps that can produce immediate results.”

Topics will include using your experience and relationships to meet your business and career goals, creating a compelling profile that helps the right people find you, successfully searches, engaging with LinkedIn members who can help you, and using hidden LinkedIn features to generate opportunities.

![](/uploads/breitbarth-3rd-edition-3D-whitebg.jpg){: .float-image-right}Breitbarth is the CEO of Power Formula LLC. He has shared his expertise with more than 80,000 business professionals through private business consulting, dynamic presentations to worldwide audiences, and his critically acclaimed book The Power Formula for LinkedIn Success (now in its third edition). He has been featured in Forbes, Inc., Wired, and American Express Open Forum and seen on NBC and Fox Business.

Breitbarth is also a certified public accountant, with degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and Marquette University.

The event is sponsored by KCC’s Office of Career Services and the KCC Young Adult Program.
