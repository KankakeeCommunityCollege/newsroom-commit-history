&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/kris-condon-dsc-8313.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;float-image-left&quot; /&gt;Dr. Kristine Condon, who teaches both for KCC’s office of Corporate and Continuing Education and Business/Technology Division, completed the certification testing in August. She has already earned separate master instructor certifications in Microsoft 97, XP, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Condon teaches short-term courses for beginning and advanced users of Microsoft Office 2016 software such as Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint and Outlook. She also teaches Microsoft Publisher, SharePoint and Project. The classes meet for about eight hours, and Condon teaches tips and tricks for getting the most out of Microsoft products. The non-credit courses use materials that prepare students for Microsoft Office Specialist certification. KCC has been a Microsoft Authorized Testing Center for Kankakee and Iroquois counties since 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses can have Condon conduct customized training in Microsoft products through the KCC Office of Continuing Education and Career Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about Microsoft Office courses, testing or customized training, phone 815-802-8200 or email&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kcondon@kcc.edu&quot;&gt; kcondon@kcc.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If participants need resumes, they are encouraged to visit KCC’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kcc.edu/coned/careerservices/pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Career Services Center&lt;/a&gt; for assistance before the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course prepares individuals for the National Registry of Food Safety Professionals exam, which is approved by the state of Illinois and the Conference for Food Protection. This certification is recognized nationwide and is valid for five years. The course and exam are offered in the same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course meets the new requirements for re-certification which went into effect on July 1, 2014. To meet the new requirements, a food service professional must complete an eight-hour Food Sanitation and Safety course and pass the re-certification exam every five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class will meet 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. Monday, Sept. 24 in Room D124 at KCC.  The course number is HLTH 520A.A23 and the $139 fee includes the book. Exam retakes are $35, and the payment is required prior to the re-take. Students can pick up a study guide prior to the first class.&lt;/p&gt;
