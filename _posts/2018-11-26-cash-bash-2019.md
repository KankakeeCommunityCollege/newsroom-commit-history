Kankakee Community College will sponsor a "Cash Bash" with a $5,000 grand prize from 6:30-11 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 16 at the Quality Inn & Suites, 800 N. Kinzie Ave. in Bradley.

There will be 24 cash prizes, totaling $7,850. To win the $5,000 grand prize or most other cash prizes, the ticket holder does not need to be present.

Admission is $100 per ticket, and each ticket admits two people for a food buffet and drinks at the event. Only 300 tickets will be sold. Proceeds benefit KCC athletic programs.

Those at the Cash Bash can play Las Vegas-style games. Drawings for at least 20 gift baskets, each valued at $50 or more, also will be held. Gift basket tickets will be sold at the event.

You must be 18 years or older to purchase a Cash Bash ticket and 21 years of age or older to attend the event.
