Eight mock trial teams from northern Illinois high schools will compete from 8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 16 at Kankakee Community College.

Prize money and a chance to compete well at Illinois State Bar Association State Competition will be at stake.

“Mock trial teams have to participate in at least one scrimmage like ours to be eligible to compete at the state level,” said Dr. Kristine Condon, KCC’s program coordinator for the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program. “KCC’s Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies students and I are excited to welcome these participants to campus.”

“This is a great opportunity for students to learn about the legal profession,” said Benjamin Lawson, attorney with Lawson & O’Brien. “This is our first year organizing this competition, but we're hoping to make it an annual event. We've had a lot of support from the community, and I'm really excited to see how well these students compete.”

Other than Lawson and Condon, the planning team includes Chief Judge Michael Kramer and Judge Tom Cunnington, both with the Illinois 21st Judicial Circuit, and Third District Appellate Justice Mary Kay O’Brien.

The mock trial competition is sponsored by the Kankakee County Bar Association and KCC’s [Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program](http://www.kcc.edu/future/choosing/occupational/paralegal/Pages/default.aspx).

KCC is located south of downtown Kankakee off River Road, near U.S. 45-52, or take Interstate 57 to Exit 308 and follow the signs. Directions are at [www.kcc.edu/directions](http://www.kcc.edu/directions).
