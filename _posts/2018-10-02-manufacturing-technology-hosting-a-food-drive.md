![](/uploads/food-pantry.jpg){: .float-image-left}Kankakee Community College’s Manufacturing Technology program is hosting a food drive during October to benefit the college’s Food Pantry.

Non-perishable and canned items will be accepted. Especially welcome are “grab-and-go” options for a quick meal or snack, such as ramen noodle cups, macaroni and cheese cups, popcorn, cereal, granola bars or fruit cups. See the complete recommended [list](http://www.kcc.edu/students/studentlife/Documents/Food-Pantry-donations.pdf){: target="_blank"}. 

Donation bins are located on KCC’s Riverfront Campus, outside Rooms L340 and W102; and at the entrance of the Manufacturing and Industrial Technology Center (MITC).

October is Manufacturing Month, and National MFG DAY is Friday, Oct. 5. These observances are designed to give manufacturers an opportunity to open their doors and show, in a coordinated effort, what manufacturing is, and isn’t.

KCC’s Manufacturing Technology program offers certificates and associate in applied science degrees, with specializations in Machine Tool; Welding; Industrial Maintenance; and Transportation, Warehousing, Distribution and Logistics (TWDL).

More information about the program is online, or phone Mark Anderson, program coordinator, at 815-802-8873.
