A Food Sanitation and Safety course is being offered this fall at Kankakee Community College.

This course prepares individuals for the National Registry of Food Safety Professionals exam, which is approved by the state of Illinois and the Conference for Food Protection. This certification is recognized nationwide and is valid for five years. The course and exam are offered in the same day.

This course meets the new requirements for re-certification which went into effect on July 1, 2014. To meet the new requirements, a food service professional must complete an eight-hour Food Sanitation and Safety course and pass the recertification exam every five years.

The class will meet 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. Monday, Sept. 24 in Room D124 at KCC. Â The course number is HLTH 520A.A23 and the $139 fee includes the book. Exam retakes are $35, and the payment is required prior to the re-take. Students can pick up a study guide prior to the first class.

This course does not award college credit. To register or for more information, call 815-802-8207; go to www.kcc.edu/comejoinus/; or visit the Welcome Center.
