On Thursday, Nov. 15, Kankakee Community College’s Miner South Extension Center will host its Fall Job Fair.

The Job Fair will be from 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. at the extension center in Watseka. It is open to the public. Admission is free.

More than 15 businesses and industries will be at the Job Fair. Employers will conduct pre-screening interviews for full- and part-time positions.

“The Job Fair is an ideal setting for students, graduates, veterans and community members to learn more about area employers and current opportunities,” said Ken Crite, KCC coordinator of Career Services. “We want participants to dress professionally, bring resumes and to enjoy the experience of meeting employers from throughout the area.”
