![](/uploads/alive-logo-small.jpg){: .float-image-right}The [ALIVE Adult Literacy Program](http://www.kcc.edu/future/gedbasics/literacy/Pages/alive.aspx) at Kankakee Community College is looking for volunteer tutors.

People are needed to teach basic skills in the areas of reading, writing and math. Tutor training is provided to volunteers free of charge. Tutors must be 18 years of age or older.

As part of the ALIVE program, tutors are paired with students and meet weekly for lessons. Tutoring sessions are held at various sites in Kankakee and Iroquois counties to make the meetings convenient for both students and tutors.

The goal of the ALIVE program is to help people improve their basic skills and quality of life.

For more information about the ALIVE program or to sign up to become a volunteer tutor, phone Shannan Carrell at 815-802-8307 or e-mail [scarrell@kcc.edu](mailto:scarrell@kcc.edu?subject=ALIVE%20tutor).
