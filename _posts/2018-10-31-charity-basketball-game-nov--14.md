A charity basketball game Wednesday, Nov. 14 will emphasize working together for the greater good.

Admission is $2 for students w/ ID and $5 for everyone else – with children under age 12 free.

All proceeds will benefit [KCC Student Advisory Council](/students/studentlife/Pages/studentadvisory.aspx) and the [KCC’s Veteran's Association](/students/studentlife/clubs/Pages/veterans.aspx). Concessions will be sold by [KCC’s STEM Club](/students/studentlife/clubs/Pages/stem-club.aspx).
