The [KCC STEM Club](http://www.kcc.edu/students/studentlife/clubs/Pages/stem-club.aspx) had a cookout and stargazing event on Monday, Oct. 8.

STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.

The event started at the East Pavilion. Fun was had with Frisbees, good food, and meeting Dr. Jessica Greminger's new baby. Greminger is one of the club's sponsors.

Then, as darkness fell, the group went out to the middle of KCC's golf course, set up the KCC telescope and checked out Mars.

"We tried to get Saturn, too, but it went behind some trees!" said Michael Caparula, one of the club's sponsors.
