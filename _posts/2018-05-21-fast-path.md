Fast Path programs are offered at two locations. Choose from either KCC’s Riverfront Campus in Kankakee, or the Miner South Extension Center in Watseka. With a predictable schedule, you’ll know class is always at the same time on the same days throughout the length of the program. That’s right. You attend classes only 2 days per week for about 3 hours per day. &nbsp;A new class begins every 8-weeks.
