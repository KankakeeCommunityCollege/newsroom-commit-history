As of Fall 2018, co-curricular transcripts are being discontinued. The company which provided service has chosen to sunset the project. 

KCC's Office of Student Life is researching new programs to possibly replace the co-curricular transcript system.

A co-curricular transcript is a record of your campus and community involvement and leadership experiences. It can be sent to other colleges, universities or employers to highlight your achievements, experiences and skills.
