![](/uploads/beglau-award-dsc-0218---copy.JPG){: .float-image-right}For his commitment to adult learners, Gregg Beglau has received the [Illinois Adult and Continuing Educators Association](https://www.iacea.net/) Support Staff of the Year Award.

“Gregg is a true advocate for our Adult Education and ESL students,” said Maggie Wolf, director of [adult education](https://adulted.kcc.edu/) at KCC. “From the point of first contact in our program to the moment they matriculate to the college, and often beyond, Gregg is there with a smile to help with whatever question is asked.”

Beglau coordinates high school equivalency and English as a Second Language courses at Kankakee Community College. The award was announced on Thursday, March 7, 2019 at the association’s conference in Springfield. Due to a family commitment and his service in the U.S. Naval Reserves, he was presented with the plaque on March 25 at KCC.

Among other criteria, it recognizes a person who accepts the cultural and ethnic uniqueness of learners; provides a non-threatening, supportive atmosphere; communicates effectively; fosters and maintains community resources; and is flexible and innovative.

“When I hit a roadblock with my financial aid, he walked me down to financial aid and stayed with me to make sure that I understood everything that they told me,” said Miguel Lara, a current student. “When times got hard, he wouldn't let me give up. He has been my biggest influence, he has taught me not to give up and to help others.”

Beglau worked part-time at KCC for six years, then was hired as the coordinator of student support and transition for the Adult Education Department in September 2016.

“Gregg is a joy to work with and an asset to our division,” said Liz East, administrative assistant for the Adult and Community Education Department. “He has such a caring personality that students can talk with him and he will try to assist their needs. His humorous personality helps to make the work environment enjoyable.”

It is the third year in a row that a KCC employee has earned a statewide award from the Illinois Adult and Continuing Educators Association. In 2017, Wolf was named the organization’s Administrator of the Year; and in 2018, Donna Mann was named the Arthur J. Stejskal Teacher of the Year.
