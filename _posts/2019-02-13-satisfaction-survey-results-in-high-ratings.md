![](/uploads/caitlyn-lease-sc-8376---copy.jpg){: .float-image-left}Kankakee Community College is the top community college in Illinois for overall student satisfaction in a cross-section of areas.

“KCC strives to provide top-quality service across all areas of the college!” said KCC’s president, Dr. John Avendano. “We pride ourselves on the quality of our programs and services. We are pleased to have students who are satisfied with a number of services, and are even more pleased to know that the satisfaction levels include several departments and service areas.”

The college’s ranking takes into account students’ answers to questions on their satisfaction with nine areas on the Ruffalo Noel Levitz Student Satisfaction Inventory: advising/counseling, responsiveness to diverse populations, admissions and financial aid, service excellence, safety and security, college experience met expectations, academic services, student centeredness, and registration effectiveness.

Eleven Illinois community colleges submitted this data to the National Community College Benchmark Project. On each of the nine benchmark items, KCC also is in the top 25 percent of all colleges nationally.

“Much like in a contest where several scores are pooled together in aggregate, KCC came out on top overall for Illinois schools who provided a number of benchmarks for comparison,” said Dr. Jose da Silva, KCC vice president for student development and services. “It is especially rewarding to know students appreciate the services we provide. We look forward to continuously evolving in order to meet the needs of our students now and in the future.”

KCC did well nationally in a number of academic areas as well.

The percentage of students who passed their first college-level math class after completing a remedial math class places KCC in the top 4 percent nationally; and the percent of students passing their distance learning classes at KCC places them in the top 20 percent nationally. The college is in the top 15 percent for first-time, full-time students who completed a degree/certificate or transferred within three years. KCC also is highly ranked—in the top 20 percent nationally—for first-time, part-time students who completed a degree/certificate within six years.<br>By using a Noel Levitz survey, individual identities remain confidential. Using a national survey also allows KCC to compare results year-to-year, and with other colleges because most questions are repeated on each college’s survey.

More information about KCC is available on the college’s website, [www.kcc.edu](http://www.kcc.edu).
