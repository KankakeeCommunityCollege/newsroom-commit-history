&nbsp;The co-curricular transcript system is no longer available. The company which provided the co-curricular transcript service has chosen to sunset the project.&nbsp;<br>KCC's Office of Student Life is researching new programs to possibly replace the co-curricular transcript system.

A co-curricular transcript is a record of your campus and community involvement and leadership experiences. It can be sent to other colleges, universities or employers to highlight your achievements, experiences and skills.&nbsp;
