The seminar will have two presentations, and participants can attend one or both. Registration is not required.

“LinkedIn: A Student’s Fast Track to Internships and Jobs” will be from 10 a.m. - noon.

“If you’re interested in quickly and easily creating a strong LinkedIn presence and growing a network that will open doors, this class is for you,” Breitbarth said.

Topics relate to using LinkedIn to finding a job, including creating a winning profile, tapping into a database of resources, developing a network, the best keywords, and connecting with school alumni to locate opportunities.

“The Power Formula for LinkedIn Success” will be from 1:30-3:30 p.m.

“This class has something for everyone,” Breitbarth said. “Whether you’re a social media novice or savvy user, you’ll come away with action steps that can produce immediate results.”

Topics will include using your experience and relationships to meet your business and career goals, creating a compelling profile that helps the right people find you, successfully searches, engaging with LinkedIn members who can help you, and using hidden LinkedIn features to generate opportunities.
