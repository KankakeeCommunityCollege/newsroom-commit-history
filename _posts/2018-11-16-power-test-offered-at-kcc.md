The Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board's “Peace Officer Wellness Evaluation Report (POWER)” test is now offered at Kankakee Community College.

The test completes the fitness entry requirements for those who are applying as candidates for various law enforcement agencies.

“We are excited to be offering a local option for the POWER Test,” said Yvonne Mills, specialist and personal trainer manager at KCC. “In addition to offering the POWER Test, KCC has high quality fitness facilities for officer candidates to train for this test, and personnel to guide them in attaining the standards the test requires.”

The POWER Test includes four components: sit and reach, sit-ups, maximum bench press and 1.5 mile run. Specific details of each test, and the standards for passing are on the [POWER Test page](https://athletics.kcc.edu/facilities/power-test/.).

More information, on applying to take the POWER Test at KCC is available on the college’s [Fitness Center page](https://athletics.kcc.edu/facilities/power-test/.) and by phone at 815-802-8610.
