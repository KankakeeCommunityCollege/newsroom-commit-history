Kankakee Community College is moving to a new accreditation process, Open Pathway.

The college is accredited through 2024 by The Higher Learning Commission, one of six regional institutional accreditors in the U.S.

“Like all accreditation methods, the Open Pathway is focused on quality assurance and institutional improvement,” said Dr. Purva Rushi, KCC’s accreditation liaison officer. “The college will continue to engage in continuous quality improvement activities and report on how it is meeting standards set forth by the HLC.”

Maintaining accreditation includes meeting requirements set by the HLC.

“The federal government has a distinct interest in the role of accreditation in assuring quality in higher education for the students who benefit from federal financial aid programs,” according to the HLC web site. “By being recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as a gatekeeper agency, the Commission agrees to fulfill specific federally defined responsibilities within the accreditation processes.”

During the 10-year accreditation cycle, KCC will create and submit a comprehensive report called an Assurance Review to show it is meeting accreditation criteria; design and complete a multi-year quality initiative; submit annual reports, and complete a comprehensive evaluation at the end of the cycle. The comprehensive evaluation will include an on-site visit by the HLC in 2024-25.

The HLC accredits degree-granting post-secondary educational institutions in 19 states in the North Central region. KCC formerly used the Academic Quality Improvement Program (AQIP) process, which is being phased out.
