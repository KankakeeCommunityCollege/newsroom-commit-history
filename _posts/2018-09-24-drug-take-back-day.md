Kankakee Community College, in conjunction with Kankakee Area Metropolitan Enforcement Group, will host a Drug Take Back event on Thursday, Oct. 25. 

"Drug Take Back" will be from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 25 in KCC's atrium area, on the first floor near the main entrance.

Members of the community are invited to attend and safely and anonymously turn in expired, unwanted, or unused prescription or over-the-counter drugs. This event is related to efforts by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency to prevent drug addiction and overdose deaths. Participants are asked to remove the labels or use a permanent marker to black-out personal information. No liquids, illegal drugs, bio-hazardous materials or sharps/needles will be accepted at the event.

The program at KCC is being sponsored by the college's Police Department and Criminal Justice Club.
