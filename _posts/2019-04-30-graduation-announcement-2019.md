A number of students, faculty and alumni accomplishments will be recognized. The speaker will be the college’s president, Dr. John Avendano. He is a community college graduate and has more than 30 years of experience working for community colleges in Illinois. 

“Over the years, as both a student and later as an employee of the community college system in Illinois, I came to fully realize the impact our two-year institutions have on the lives of those we serve,” Avendano said. “As a result, I have dedicated my entire career to the mission and purpose of community colleges.”

The other All-Academic Team member, Joseph Sikma of Bourbonnais, will receive an Associate in Science transfer degree. Next, he will attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ![](/uploads/amy-porter-dsc-8253.jpg){: .float-image-right}
